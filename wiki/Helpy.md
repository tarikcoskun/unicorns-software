# Behavior

Helpy has a battery system where it loses battery when it moves, but is able to regain it by moving to the right wall of the level. If Helpy leaves this wall, it will stop regenerating charge. Helpy will move to where it predicts the ball will land, sending it back to Shelly's side. If Shelly stays within its line of sight for too long, it will charge a laser aimed with pinpoint accuracy at Shelly. If Shelly does not leave Helpy's line of sight, its laser will fire, killing Shelly instantly.

# Strategy

Helpy can be killed if the ball lands on its side of the field. This can be done by making Helpy run out of battery or forcing the ball to a position that it cannot return the ball to Shelly.

# Trivia

- During Will You Snail's development, there was originally a different boss for Chapter D based on Tower Defense. This was scrapped (Along with several other tower defense levels, although they were moved and became secret levels) and Helpy replaced said boss.[^1]
